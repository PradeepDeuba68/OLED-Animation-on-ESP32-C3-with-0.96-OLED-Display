# OLED-Animation-on-ESP32-C3-with-0.96-OLED-Display
This project demonstrates how to display a smooth 24 FPS animation on a 0.96-inch OLED display  using the ESP32-C3 microcontroller. It uses the Adafruit GFX and SSD1306 libraries for easy graphics handling. The code includes frame data and animation logic to showcase advanced OLED animation techniques suitable for ESP32-based embedded projects.
